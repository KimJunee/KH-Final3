    p As has been mentioned in previous section, <span class='fw-bold'>Gulp</span> is a JavaScript task runner. It helps with performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc. This is possible thanks to extensive Gulp Plugins library.
    p
      | Gulp tasks are already set up for you. They are stored inside <code>Finder/gulpfile.js</code>. But in order to have access to them via you Command Line tool you will need to install <span class='fw-bold'>gulp-cli node package</span>. Gulp CLI stands for Gulp Command Line Interface. 
      u.d-block.text-dark.pt-2 To do that type following line in your terminal:
    kbd.d-inline-block.mb-3 npm install -g gulp-cli
    span.d-block.text-info.mb-4 * if you are on Mac make sure to use <span class='fw-bold'>sudo</span> to install packages globally otherwise you may runt into error.

    h2.h4.pt-3 Gulp CLI commands
    ul.pt-2
      li.pb-3 
        kbd.me-2 gulp
        | or
        kbd.ms-2 npm run build
        |  - this main command will fire default gulp task which includes: <u class='text-dark'>launching BrowserSync, moving vendor libraries from node_modules directory to dist folder, javascript, sass and pug compilation and lanching watch task</u>. BrowserSync will create dev server and sync your browser with your code editor. Note: to use other separate tasks explained below you will need to open other Terminal window and leave the one with running server intact.
      li.pb-3 
        kbd gulp clean
        |  - as the name implies it cleans dist folder from generated (compiled assests like css, js, vendor libs, etc.)
      li.pb-3 
        kbd gulp vendor
        |  - moves vendor libraries from <code>node_modules</code> directory to <code>dist</code> folder. Please check this article explaining how to add new vendor plugin to your project - <a href='install-vendor-plugin.html' class='fw-bold'>Installing Vendor plugins with Npm and Gulp</a>
      li.pb-3 
        kbd.me-2 gulp js:expanded
        | and
        kbd.ms-2 gulp js:minified
        |  - compiles ES6 modules from <code>src/js</code> folder, applies polyfill using Babel and then minifies and uglifies main <code>theme.js</code> file and creates 2 files in <code>dist/js</code> folder: <code>theme.js</code> and <code>theme.min.js</code>. The latter is linked to your HTML document. Babel gives you an opportunity to write ES6 javascript and be sure it will be compiled to ES5 js that has a better support across browsers.
      li.pb-3 
        kbd gulp pug
        |  - compiles <code>.pug</code> from <code>src/templates</code> folder into HTML in <code>dist</code> folder.
      li.pb-3 
        kbd gulp sass:expanded
        |  - compiles <code>.scss</code> files into non-minified CSS (css/theme.css). From <code>src</code> to <code>dist</code> folder.
      li.pb-3 
        kbd gulp sass:minified
        |  - compiles <code>.scss</code> files into minified CSS (css/theme.min.css). From <code>src</code> to <code>dist</code> folder.
      li.pb-3 
        kbd gulp watch
        |  - launches <code>watch</code> task. It will watch changes of your <code>.scss</code> / <code>.js</code> / <code>.pug</code> files and automatically compile them into <code>.css</code> / <code>.js</code> / <code>.html</code>.
